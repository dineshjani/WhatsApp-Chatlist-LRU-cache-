# WhatsApp-Chatlist-LRU-cache
In this project i implement chatlist which has two operation:

    1.when we get a new Message that message from that person goes to top of the list and all the remaining element shift down by one position.if a new person in not in
    the chatlist then all the message will shift down.
    
    2.when i delete a message then below this message will shift upward till the occupying empty space.
    
 Data-structure which can perform in these operation will be
    1.find
    
    2.shift to front
    
    3.delete
    
 i take some principal from LRU cache and implement these operation in O(1) complexity.For implement lru cache i used linkedlist,hashmap in JAVASCRIPT.
